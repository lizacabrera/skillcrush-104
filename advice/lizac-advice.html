			<h4>Walking away <span>REALLY</span> does help!</h4>
			<p>Be ready for frustration. The "throw your computer out the window" feeling is real and we all get it once in a while! </p>

			<p>While you DO need to practice resilience in order to move forward, you'll reach a point, after staring at the code for too long, where you just need a break.  Walk away, play a game for 15 minutes, scroll social media, read a post from your favorite blog- ANYTHING that will give your brain a little reset!</p>

			<h4>Help is a <span>Two Way</span> Street</h4>
			<p>Using Google Groups to reach out for help from fellow students is one of your most powerful resources.  Not only are your classmates super supportive, it's encouraging to see someone had the same question you did! Maybe even more valuable- when someone reaches out with a question, take the time to scroll through the code and see if you can help.</p>

			<p>Reading through someone else's code on the same project shows you how different developers approach the same goal.  It's a great learning opportunity for you to practice finding the key to unlocking a coding or styling obstacle!</p>
